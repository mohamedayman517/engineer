# Port for the server (Railway will set this automatically)
PORT=5000

# MongoDB connection string (for Railway, you'll need to add MongoDB service)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/architectbot

# For production on Railway, you'll need to:
# 1. Add MongoDB service to your Railway project
# 2. Set MONGODB_URI to the connection string provided by Railway
# Example: MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/architectbot
